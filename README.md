OR

If you would like to understand more about the code behind the app and edit it, click "<> code" - the green button. After clicking, in the local tab, copy the SSH key. Open the terminal in your Macbook or [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you have Windows, and type:

```bash
git clone [paste ssh key]
```

I would recommend downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit the code locally.

## Usage/Examples

Voyage is a tool that enables you to check the weather for any city at any time. You can easily search for a destination and see current and 5-day forecast weather conditions. When you view weather conditions for that city you will be able to see the city name, the date, icons that represent weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
