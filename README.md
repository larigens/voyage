## Installation

If you would like to understand more about the code behind the app and edit it:

### Cloning the Repository

Click `<> code` - the green button. After clicking, in the local tab, copy the SSH key. Open the terminal in your Macbook or [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you have Windows/Linux, and type:

```bash
git clone [paste ssh key]
```

I would recommend downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit the code locally. If you need more information on how to clone a repository, [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)!

## Usage

Voyage is a tool that enables you to check the weather for any city at any time. You can easily search for a destination and see current and 5-day forecast weather conditions. When you view weather conditions for that city you will be able to see the city name, the date, icons that represent weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

It will also store the searched city so that you can easily access the information of that city by clicking on the button located in the sidebar.

BONUS: You can choose the measurement system that makes sense for you! The Switch in the upper right corner of the dashboard allows you to change the units at any time!
